 "AI" is "Artificial Intelligence". That is a program which thinks as if a human does. A single word "AI" covers a lot of meanings, for instance, it can be told "thinking" that Runba remembers the structure of a room.
  
  First, I'll talk about AR.
 AR is a technology which put CG onto real landscape from a camera in real time.
 ==========Here, actually show==============
 These technologies are used in some scene, such as in smart phone applications or in Google Glass.
 Development of that will lead to a screen floating in the air like in the movies.

 The next topic is AI.
 When you hear "AI", you probably imagine something talking with a human.Actually, some AI is made for converse with people and the progress of that is going good.
 The active study of AI began in 1950's, but the number of programs which can talk as well as people mistake for a human is small so far.
 There are no programs which can cheat everyone, I guess.
 That's why a program generally takes a given action in a given situation. On the other hand, humans can immediately create a new word or grammer and share. This is a point of difference between a program and a human.
 So not only conversation, a triumph to make a program close to a huma n includes making it possible for it to learn or create a new notion.
